## How's It Built
This project was built in 3D Unity using 3D Unity in VR using data for recipes pulled from Wegmans API. All the art assets were made in Photopea and other online imaging software with the 3D models from the Unity Asset Store. The website was created with the Bootstrap Grayscale template.

## Challenges
We initially wanted to create an in depth tutorial UI screen to explain what the ingredients are, and some side recipes you can use. However we had a difficult time setting up the environment to work with 3D models from the asset store as everything came in as hot magenta models with no working shaders. Eleanor's laptop was scarified and we had to borrow a laptop.
