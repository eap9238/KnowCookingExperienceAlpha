# KnowCookingExperience

## Team Name
JBC Peach

##Elevator Pitch
Rather than blow up your kitchen in real life, learn how to cook in virtual reality!

## Inspiration
Inspired by our love for cooking and Cooking Mama!

## What it does
Takes the player through a step-by-step process of a recipe of their choice pulled from the Wegmans' API.

## How we built it
This project was built in 3D Unity using 3D Unity in VR using data for recipes pulled from Wegmans API. All the art assets were made in Photopea and other online imaging software with the 3D models from the Unity Asset Store. The website was created with the Bootstrap Grayscale template.

## Challenges we ran into
We initially wanted to create an in depth tutorial UI screen to explain what the ingredients are, and some side recipes you can use. However we had a difficult time setting up the environment to work with 3D models from the asset store as everything came in as hot magenta models with no working shaders. Eleanor's laptop was scarified and we had to borrow a laptop.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Art is fabulous. Website is stylish. Game is functional.

## What we learned
Learning VR in a 24 hour hackathon wasn't the greatest idea...

## What's next for Know Cooking Experience
More game levels!. Fully stock recipe book!. Polished game UI.
